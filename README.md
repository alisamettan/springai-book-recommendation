# Spring AI Book Recommendations

Spring AI is a platform that provides personalized book recommendations based on user responses to a series of questions. The process involves sending user responses to the OpenAI API for processing with the GPT model. The recommendations generated by GPT are then displayed to the user on the UI.

2. **Processing with GPT**: User responses are sent to the OpenAI API and processed by the GPT model.
